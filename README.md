# TODO app

## Stories implemented

- (required): I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list
- (required): I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can (for example) edit our family shopping-list together
- I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on things that are still pending
- I as a user can filter the to-do list and view items that were marked as done - so that I can retrospect on my prior progress
- I as a user can add sub-tasks to my to-do items - so that I could make logical groups of tasks and see their overall progress
- I as a user can specify cost/price for a task or a subtask - so that I can track my expenses / project cost
- I as a user can see the sum of the subtasks aggregated in the parent task - so that in my shopping list I can see what contributes to the overall sum. For example I can have a task “Salad”, where I'd add all ingredients as sub-tasks, and would see how much does salad cost on my shopping list
- I as a user can make infinite nested levels of subtasks
- I as a user can add sub-descriptions of tasks (without Markdown)
- I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that I can share with my friends - so that I could have separate to do lists for my groceries and work related tasks
- I as a user can be sure that my todos will be persisted so that important information is not lost when server restarts
